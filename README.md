# Hybrid Customer Segmentation and Repurchase Prediction Framework
This project proposes a hybrid cluster-then-predict framework for customer segmentation and repurchase prediction using RFMT behavioral analysis and machine learning models.

The framework integrates:
- RFMT feature engineering
- Multiple clustering algorithms
- Cluster-based classification
- SMOTE-Tomek imbalance handling

The study evaluates whether segment-specific predictive models outperform traditional global prediction approaches.
